    "1. URL Mapping: App routes define the mapping between URLs and the functions that handle requests for those URLs, allowing Flask applications to respond to specific URLs with appropriate content or actions.\n",

    "4. RESTful APIs: App routes are commonly used in Flask for building RESTful APIs, where different routes correspond to different API endpoints, each handling specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for data manipulation.\n",
